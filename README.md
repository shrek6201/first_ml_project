# first_ml_project
This is the first Machine Learning model I built using the SciKit learn library.
I have used an example dataset containing some molecular logs.
Then I trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models on said dataset.
Lastly, I have included a scatterplot and a trend line as a comparison between both Linear Regression model & Random Forest model.
